# Issues
This is a repository for reporting any issues in any of my software

Click on the Issues tab above to submit a bug or suggestion to any of my projects. While individual parsers or completely open source projects can also be used for this kind of thing, this repo can be used for GUIs or anything else that does not fit in anywhere else.

Please be as descriptive as possible including what the issue is, how to reproduce it, and, if possible, please send me data that illustrates the issue being reported.

Thanks!

Eric
